This tutorial helps me to know :

1. About the useState in hooks 
2. const [count , setCount] = useState("white")
   count - current state
   setCount - function (we have to use this most of the place's just like this project I have done)
3. I have taken two components and inside one component I have imported another component {Inside BodyParts i have imported Header}
4. CSS parts are also there which I have taken help from the video and used Bootstrap as a third party library
