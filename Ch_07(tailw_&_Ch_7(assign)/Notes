Ch-07

Here I learnt little bit about Tailwind 
For installing Tailwind css : 
In terminal 

npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

tailwind.config.js
content: [

   "./index.html",

   "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",

 ],

Index.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;


AFTER THAT I FOCUES ON THE PROPS CONCEPTS THAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM BASIC PROPS .
NOTE : Navbar I have taken from Bootstrap and Carts are from Tailwind (Both are third party libraies)
