1. How to create the reference

let btnref = useRef();

2. How to link the reference 

ref={btnref}

3. How to access and change the reference 

btn0.current.style.backgroundColor = "red";


3 Hooks theory:
In a classroom teacher is teaching something , I am taking my personal notes in my notebook this is useRef ,if I am reading my notes in front of the class then it's useState means ui getting changes and useEffect 
occurs when teacher seen something unimportant i have written in my notes silently and call my parents then its 
an example of useEffect . So the difference b/w useRef and UseEffect is useRef can manipulate DOM and store the 
value's without rerendering while useState can directly rerender the ui . 
So here the difference b/w useRef,useEffect with useState is can rerender while both of them can't .

useState(state hook) : Store data and update the ui .
UseEffect(side effect hook) : It's a react hook for side effects . eg: Api calls,timers
useRef(Reference hook) : It's a react hook for storing a reference eg : DOMs effect (get element by id , get element by class name instead of that we use useRef hooks)
